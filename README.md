#Tamagotchi

This is one of my first projects using Javascript Object Orientated design, jQuery and CSS. An immitation of the popular toy out of the 1990's - this Tamagotchi is also ultra dependent on it's owner; requiring constant feeding, play time, and rest. Careful that the points don't run out, or your poor tamagotch will perish!
